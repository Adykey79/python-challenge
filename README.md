# The first part, analysis of PyBank's financial records:

I created a Python script to analyze a company's financial records in this challenge. Here I have a financial dataset called budget_data.csv, which consists of "date" and "profit/loss" columns.

Here I created a Python script that parses the records to calculate each of the following values:

- The total number of months in the dataset

- The total amount of net "profit/loss" for the entire period

- "Profit/Loss" changes over the entire period and then the average of those changes

- The highest profit increase (date and amount) in the entire period

- The largest decrease in profit (date and amount) in the entire period
