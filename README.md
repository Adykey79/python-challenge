# PyBank's Financial Analysis:

I created a Python script to analyze a company's financial records in this challenge. Here I have a financial dataset called budget_data.csv, which consists of "date" and "profit/loss" columns.

Here I created a Python script that parses the records to calculate each of the following values:

- The total number of months in the dataset

- The total amount of net "profit/loss" for the entire period

- "Profit/Loss" changes over the entire period and then the average of those changes

- The highest profit increase (date and amount) in the entire period

- The largest decrease in profit (date and amount) in the entire period

 # PyPoll's Modernized Vote-Counting Process:
 
In this challenge, by creating a Python script, I analyzed a set of survey data named election_data.csv, which consists of three columns "Voter ID", "County" and "Candidate", and I calculated each of the following values:

- The total number of votes cast

- A complete list of candidates who received votes

- The percentage of votes each candidate won

- The total number of votes each candidate won

- The winner of the election based on popular vote
